{"name":"HSS ","tagline":"","body":"### Welcome to HSS Pages.\r\nHSS is short for \"HEI SHENG SHA\", a card-playing game like \"SAN GUO SHA\". \r\nThe differences between them is playing roles and many other aspects.\r\nSource code includes client and server code. Client code is based on PYTHON while \r\nserver code based on erlang, a concurrency-oriented programming language.\r\nThe most important thing for us is: HAVE FUN!!!\r\n\r\n### How to get source code, sorry, you can't checkin any code\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:spookyy/hss.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Why python for client\r\nUhh, the truth is no reason. I myself very like python. That's the only reason. Long long ago when I tried to find a language for client part, I thought why not, python can do everything for me. Another reason is that I'm a newbie, I need practice. As the old saying goes, practice makes perfect.\r\n\r\nTo run this code, you should have python, pyQt4, cocos2d-python, pygame in your enviroment.\r\n\r\nFYI:\r\n```\r\n loginpage.py ---> login page, you should firstly and only run it\r\n hall.py      ---> hall page, you can either create a room or \r\n                   choose a room to join\r\n room.py      ---> the \"main\" page where you actually playing game\r\n```\r\n### how to run the client\r\n```\r\n$ python loginpage.py\r\n```\r\n### Why erlang for server\r\nInteresting. Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance. I am familiar with it and it is convenient and quick to build a realiable server with erlang. YOu can get anything about erlang at:http://www.erlang.org/. You are welcome to share somethin interesting with @spookyy, or email me at qmchen2011@126.com.\r\n\r\n### How to start server\r\nTo build this code, run the following command:\r\n\r\n1) to build src files\r\n```  \r\n$ erlc -o ebin src/*.erl\r\n```\r\n2) start erl shell\r\n```\r\n$ erl -pa ebin/ -sname unode@uhost -mnesia dir '\"/where/your/hss/is/\"'\r\n```  \r\n3) You should start the mnesia in the shell\r\n```\r\n$erl> mnesia:start().\r\n```\r\n4) In erl shell, you should run:\r\n```  \r\n$erl> application:start(hss).\r\n```\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nAnthing wrong with code, pls contact qmchen2011@126.com\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
