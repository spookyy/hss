This is for instruction!!!
To build this code, run the following command:
================================================================================

  Before everything get started, at the very beginning, you should:
  A) mnesia:dirty_write(#identity{id=1, name="root",password="root"})
  B) mnesia:dirty_write({room,room_id_1,"ROOM A",0,not_ready}).
     mnesia:dirty_write({room,room_id_2,"ROOM B",0,not_ready}).
     mnesia:dirty_write({room,room_id_3,"ROOM C",0,not_ready}).
     mnesia:dirty_write({room,room_id_4,"ROOM D",0,not_ready}).
     mnesia:dirty_write({room,room_id_5,"ROOM E",0,not_ready}).
  After you do the commands over, data is stored on disk and you won't or shouldn't
have to do that shit again.

  So, then everytime when you update some code, you may follow the setups below, enjoy it.
=================================================================================
  1) to build src files
 
  erlc -o ebin src/*.erl

  2) start erl shell
   
  erl -pa ebin/ -sname cqm@opensuse -mnesia dir '"/where/hss/is/||~/hss/client"'
  
  3) You'd better start the mnesia in the shell
  
  mnesia:start().
  
  4) In erl shell, you should run:
  
  application:start(hss).
  
  5) how to create a table and write a record into table
  %%% create a table
  case mnesia:create_table(identity, [{type, ordered_set}, 
		{attributes, record_info(fields, identity)}, {disc_copies,[node()]}]) of
    	{atomic, ok} ->
    	    ok;
    	{aborted, MnesiaNoCreateTableReason} ->
    	    io:format("what's up"),
    	    exit(MnesiaNoCreateTableReason)
  end,
  %%% write a record
  mnesia:dirty_write(#identity{id=12222222, name="weirdo",password="youguess"})
